# How An Astronaut's Experience Can Enable Us To Study Better From Home

For most of us, we’re going into week 2 studying and working from home. Obviously, we’re not made to stay in a confined space for that long. That’s why it’s even more important to be deliberate about how we go about our daily lives. 

In the subsequent post, we summarize key learnings from an astronaut’s experience in space. Back in 2015 / 2016, Scott Kelly spent nearly a year in space living on the ISS. In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/opinion/scott-kelly-coronavirus-isolation.html" target="_blank">interview</a> with the New York Times, he admits it “wasn’t always easy but I learned some things during my time up there”. His experience clearly shows that there is a way to get around this. It is important to be intentional about our decisions.

## Follow a routine

“Maintaining a plan will help you adjust to a different environment”, says Kelly. “On the space station, my time was scheduled tightly, from the moment I woke up to when I went to sleep”. 

Now that classes are remote, it’s easier to let a regular schedule skip. We see it ourselves. For example, the gym is closed and of course it’s harder to work out at home. However, keeping a set schedule will prevent us from slipping into a world where we end up only sitting on the couch, smoking weed, and eating unhealthy food. While you’re at it, this might be a good time to incorporate some good habits into your set schedule, like meditation or Wim Hof breathing. And if you need some motivation, we have just the right <a href="https://davidgoggins.com/book/" target="_blank">book</a> for you to get started.

## Pace yourself

“When you are living and working in the same place for days on end, work can have a way of taking over everything if you let it”, Kelly argues. “Living in space, I deliberately paced myself because I knew I was in it for the long haul.”

There are many different ways to achieve that - take time to read a book, call friends, or take a nap. We see it ourselves here at Polar. There is always one more thing that needs to be done, always one additional discussion to be had. However, a refreshed mind is able to get much more done than an overworked one. So make sure you pace yourself.
On the flip side, make sure you don’t “pace yourself” too much. <a href="https://shyamsankar.com/the-case-against-work-life-balance-owning-your-future" target="_blank">It's interesting</a> how people typically only argue “it’s a marathon, not a sprint” to argue for more comfort, not of sustained excellence

## Spent time outside (while keeping social distance)

One of the main advantages of living in the Bay Area is nature. Obviously, with every passing day, it’s becoming harder to spend time outside. But while it’s still possible, make sure you take go for walks and get some fresh air. Of course while maintaining the required social distance. In fact, while you’re at it, you might want to consider wearing a mask, even if just makeshift. There is early indication that masks are a key part in fighting the spread of the virus. So, do go outside while staying reasonable.

## Focus on hobbies

Duh. This is obvious but we tend to forget it in times of stress (like finals, or… a pandemic). Usually, reading is a good first try. Now you might argue you’re already reading a lot for school (and simplifying your reading and information management with <a href="https://getpolarized.io" target="_blank">Polar</a> ;) ). That’s ok. Do something else. I recently picked up yoga and cooking again. Whatever it is, make sure it gives you the timeout you need from your studies

## Start journaling

NASA discovered that keeping a journal is one of the most effective activities to keep us sane. Interesting, right? “Even if you don’t wind up writing a book based on your journal like I did, writing about your days will help put your experiences in perspective and let you look back later on what this unique time in history has meant”, Kelly shares. There are many different versions of journaling out there. I’ve been doing my own version of it for over 10 years and absolutely love it. While you’re at it, definitely add affirmations to it. Then go out and kick butt achieving those goals.

## Take time to connect

Do we really have to mention this? “Isolation is damaging not only to our mental health, but to our physical health as well, especially our immune system”, Kelly warns. Make sure you regularly connect with loved ones and close friends. Now might even be a good time to reconnect with this one person you’ve lost contact with a while back...

## Listen to expert voices

And finally… listen to experts. “Living in space taught me a lot about the importance of trusting the advice of people who knew more than I did about their subjects”, Kelly shares. Given how much misinformation is actively being spread these days about the coronavirus (did you <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51735367" target="_blank">hear</a> how onions and garlic can prevent the spread of coronavirus?), make sure you listen to people with authority in the subject.
