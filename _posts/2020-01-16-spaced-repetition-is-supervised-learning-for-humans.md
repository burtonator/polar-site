# Spaced Repetition is Supervised Learning for Humans

What if you could train your brain the way computer scientists train computers and effectively remember anything you
want - forever?

On the surface this sounds rather absurd. You're not a computer.  You can't be forced to learn new things.  Education is
complicated and (if you're like me) there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason why some knowledge sticks while you
fail to grasp other (often more complicated) concepts.

Cognitive science has found a way to solve this problem.  It turns out that we've had a solution to this problem for
more than 135 years and the tools are finally starting to become mainstream.

This connection between supervised learning (AKA machine learning) and spaced repetition was my motivation for building
Polar. I wanted a unified learning platform that exploited spaced repetition and made it easy to use and incorporate
into your workflow.

I'll get to the connection between spaced repetition and supervised learning in a moment but it's probably best to 
first explain spaced repetition.

## Background in Learning

Spaced repetition is centered around what's known as the 'forgetting curve' and directly exploits the way the brain
encodes knowledge.

The forgetting curve is based on the intuition that it's best to study something *just* before it's forgotten.

This was discovered in 1885 by [Hermann_Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) when he was
researching the rate of information loss when trying to memorize three letter syllables.

As an aside, Ebbinghaus's major innovation, in my opinion was the use of data and statistics to learn how the brain
functioned internally. Prior to Ebbinghaus, most "research" on memory was done by philosophers without any form of 
scientific rigor (at least no where near Ebbinghaus).

It might be best to think of these as time intervals from when you originally studied a piece of information.

Let's say you wanted to remember that "Fe is the chemical symbol for Iron."  This is actually a bit complicated (at
least for English speakers) as Fe is taken from the Latin word for iron - ferrum.

You can imagine that this would be quickly forgotten so you might want to recall it twenty minutes before it's forgotten.

It's this observation that the intervals keep increasing which makes spaced repetition so powerful.

Typical intervals her would involve reviewing the material at 20 minutes, 1 hour, 4hour, 8hour, etc intervals.  These 
would keep increasing exponentially until you're reviewing the material with intervals of years, not minutes.

This is eventually a scheduling system to supervise your brain to learn complicated topics which your brain wouldn't 
normally be able to encode.  Supervised learning for humans.  It's almost a *cognitive prosthetic* designed for force
you to learn.  

## Exponential Decay

One key innovation is that spaced repetition intervals use exponential decay.  

What the heck is exponential decay?  

FIXME: (this is wrong) For all my fellow math geeks these intervals would essentially mirror a y=x^1.3.



10 years, one review per week, 15s per review, this would mean a total of 2.2 hours of review.

 




What's key about the forgetting curve is that it exploits exponential decay.



- explain exponential backoff... 
- include a chart of the learning curve

    - It's easier to commit to learning something if you know it will never be forgotten
    
- What is Machine Learning?

  - unsupervised is where the algorithm, inherently knows what to do and 
    generally tends to do the right thing.
    
  - supervised learning is training a computer
  
- What is Supervised Learning?

- Cognitive prosthetic

- Other Mnemonic Strategies 
    - these can accelerate spaced repetition but (in my opinion) are not a replacement for SR.
