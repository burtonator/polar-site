# Polar 1.5 with Cloud Sync

### Support for multi-device sync based on Google Firebase

I'm proud to announce that Polar 1.5 shipped this morning.  One of the most exciting features of this release is support
for cloud sync.  

Cloud sync allows you to keep all your documents, PDFs, web page captures, and annotations consistent across all 
your computers (MacOS, Windows, and Linux).

Cloud sync is also real time.  If your other computers are online while you're using Polar they are synchronized and
up to date immediately.

We've also recently released our new <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-polar/jkfdkjomocoaljglgddnmhcbolldcafd">Chrome Extension</a>
which allows you to capture web content directly from within Chrome and share it to Polar.

# Cloud Sync Pricing

The goal is to make cloud sync freemium and to only charge for a small percentage of users.  We're trying to target 5%
of the users who use the most data.  

Initially, we're going to play with the threshold on the amount of data we're going to allow before charging for data 
usage.

Per month charges will be $7.99 for up to 10GB of storage and smaller repositories will be free.  

Right now we haven't enabled data plans and this should ship shortly.  

That said, we'd like to make it free for anyone using Polar.  If you invite other uses and they sign up for a Polar data 
package we'll give you a free month of service.  

We're also not limiting the number of users you invite.  If you invite 1k users and they all sign up and become users 
we're more than willing to give you 1000 months of storage!  

# Stability and Bug Fixes

One of the things that's been great about our initial MVP release is that the Polar community has really stepped up and 
contributed a ton of positive feedback on how to improve the platform.

We've implemented a ton of features and bug fixes in this release.  

Some of these include smaller but critical issues like key bindings but also have a critical bug fix annotations in PDF 
documents sometimes requiring reload.

# What's Next

- For all you Firefox fans we do have plans to port it over to Firefox.  Luckily it's should already work on Firefox
thanks to the WebExtensions API.

- Support for real-time document sharing with other Polar uses.  

- Improved support for capturing your full browser history.  

- Improving our Anki-sync support with other metadata fields and cloze deletions.
