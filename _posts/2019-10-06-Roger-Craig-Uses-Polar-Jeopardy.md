# Roger Craig used Polar to Win Jeopardy.

Polar has been rapidly adopted by alpha-geeks to combat information overload and looks like we've found another convert - 
this time <a href="https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-a-jeopardy-champion-remembers">Roger Craig who used it to win $77k on Jeopardy</a>.

> Heâ€™s a machine learning, data science, and AI practitioner who combined his computer skills and an interest in quiz
> games into something extraordinarily unique:
  
> He won more than half a million dollars on Jeopardy!, including a whopping $77,000 in a single day.
  
> He did this not just with raw intelligence, but by creating a system to help him fashion himself into a game-show
> superstar.

Roger and I have similar backgrounds - both machine learning and big data and it looks like we arrived at the same
general strategy for managing knowledge.  Specifically, use tools like NLP, clustering, and spaced repetition to force
material to be stored in your brain long term with high retention.

> How he uses Polarized to save and take notes on PDFs
  
> The next tool I use is called Polarized. A lot of the information I consume is in technical published papers, which are in PDFs, and Polarized helps with that. 
  
> It takes in PDFs and web pages, and allows you to highlight and annotate them. You can also export them, so you can turn the annotations into Anki cards.
  
> So basically every paper that is of interest to me, I save it into one big directory, and then Polarized goes in and ingests all of the papers and makes them available for me to read and annotate. 

What Roger did here was basically take his background in ML and built a set of tools to manage his learning.

I basically did the same thing when I first started working on Polar but I realized that this tool needs to be democratized.

We're going to be building in more cloud learning and big data capabilities in Polar in the next few months including
support for full-text search, clustering, auto-tagging, etc.

The entire point of Polar is that we're trying to democratize this technology and make it usable to the average person.

As an aside, it's been really interesting to see who's been using Polar.  Lots of PhD students, VCs, researchers, 
academics, scientists, etc.  Very exciting to see such amazingly smart people using the product.

Stay tuned!
