Polar supports storing PDF and web content in a document repository which
allows you to manage these documents with tags and to managed the documents
themselves using annotations including text and area highlights, comments, 
and flashcards.

We refer to the process of taking a web page and storing it within Polar as 
'capturing' and during this process we fetch the full HTML, including iframes,
and store them in a portable PHZ file that can be used for long term 
archival of web content.
