# Web Page Capture

Polar supports long term web page archival via a process called "capture" which 
downloads the content locally and stores it in Polar as if it were any other
type of document (like PDF).

One issue with annotating documents on the web is that the author might change
the document (or even delete it) thereby invalidating your annotations.

Polar prevents that by capturing the content on disk (and in the cloud) for your
own long term usage.

We additionally capture the document in a way to make them more usable and more 
readable.

# Link Rot

Capture prevents the problem of "link rot" where URLs vanish from the web over
time due to a natural form of attribution.  Either the domain expires or the 
content is deleted or the location changed.

The <a

Archive</a> has found that more than 9M URLs on Wikipedia return 404 error
pages.

With Polar you never have to worry about this being an issue as you have a 
permanent long term copy of important content.

# Capture

With capture in Polar the user either gives us a URL via the Polar chrome 
extension or by triggering a capture directly inside Polar.
