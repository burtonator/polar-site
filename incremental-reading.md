# Incremental Reading

Pagemarks are a new concept for tracking your reading inspired by incremental
reading. Pagemarks allow suspend and resume of reading for weeks and months in
the future until you're ready to resume, without losing your place.

Pagemarks are contrasted with bookmarks in that a bookmark is only a simple
pointer.

Pagemarks allow you to specify a range, or multiple ranges.  Additionally,
pagemarks are used to keep track of the total progress of the document and to
sort documents in the document repository by their reading progress..
