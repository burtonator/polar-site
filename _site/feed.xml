&lt;p&gt;For the past view users I’ve been using Anki to capture anything I want to
remember long term.  If I’m reading an important Wikipedia page I save it to
Polar, annotate it directly, then create flashcards from the annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this to my textbooks and anything else I find important enough to remember
forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason SR is so effective for me is it allows me to efficiently schedule
when to review the material. I’m not constantly reviewing material I already
know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my tips and tricks for using Anki and SR for language learning, pursing
a medical degree, undergraduate degree, or just trying to be the smartest person
in the room!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tips will work on any spaced repetition platform including Anki, Quizlet,
or Memrise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understand-how-it-works&quot;&gt;Understand How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you should read a bit about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition&quot;&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/a&gt; and make sure you know how
it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is key or you’re going to make silly mistakes and revert to the old strategy
of learning and cramming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-it-easy&quot;&gt;Make it Easy.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating flashcards needs to be easy use a tool like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt; so that you can create flashcards, comments,
and annotations directly while you’re reading the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once created the flashcards can all be sync’d to Anki in batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prevents you from going back and forth between Anki and your reading app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Polar supports incremental reading so you can go back and forth
between books and continue where you left off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;active-recall&quot;&gt;Active Recall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also understand why active recall (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall) is so important&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Active recall is a principle of efficient learning, which claims the need to
actively stimulate memory during the learning process. It contrasts with passive
review, in which the learning material is processed passively (e.g. by reading,
watching, etc.). For example, reading a text about George Washington, with no
further action, is a passive review. Answering the question “Who was the first
US President?”, is active recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially you want everything to be a question and you want to have to think of the
answer. It’s this thinking process which allows your brain to map weights to specific
neurons and actually learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t give leading questions or give your self hints to the answer. If you don’t
know the questions that’s fine.  Just fail it so it’s brought up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;habit-habit-habit&quot;&gt;Habit, Habit, Habit.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You couldn’t sit down at the end of the month and brush your teeth for 2-3 hours
to make up for not brushing would you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has to be a habit. You have to do it every day for 15-45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do it when you have dead time.  During  your commute. While you’re in line at the DMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you’re bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;think-long-term&quot;&gt;Think LONG Term.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t give up on cards after you’ve finished a class or other milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool thing about SR is that you can keep the material forever.  If you paid
money to learn Calculus you might as well keep it.  Once you’ve learned it
using SR is mostly about maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you know the material the scheduling will get farther and farther in the
future and there won’t be such a massive burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-the-right-card-type&quot;&gt;Use the Right Card Type&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should prefer to use question and answer cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are in the form of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q: What is the capital of California?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A: Sacramento&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be as opposed to cloze deletion cards like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Sacramento] is the capital of California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above the ‘Sacramento’ string is hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloze deletion cards might seem easy but they often give away context clues
which weakens the entire point of SR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cloze Deletions for Languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one main exception for cloze deletion cards - languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloze can be good to help with grammar and sentence structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should NOT replace Q/A cards though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a given word you should have the definition and the forward and reverse translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;person-cards--remember-a-persons-face&quot;&gt;Person cards.  Remember a Person’s Face!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite hacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have trouble with matching names to faces and I used to avoid talking to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just create a card with their picture and the answer is their name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really help avoid awkward social situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;related-cards&quot;&gt;Related Cards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling with a card try creating related cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if you have difficulties remembering the reasons for the start of WWII
make flashcards about those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to include Pearl Harbor for example maybe you include facts about
the ships or the types of attacks that were involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-only-beneficial-cards&quot;&gt;Create only Beneficial Cards.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t create nonsense cards. Ask yourself will this really help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that SR is an efficient scheduler so going from 5-10k cards isn’t 2x
more work.  It is initially but quickly your spacings increase and you’re going
to just be reviewing a few cards per day again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by only keeping important cards in there this helps you avoid card
burnout since you’re never wondering “why” you’re learning these cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The why is because they’re valuable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing key facts might still land you that job.  If you know a technical term
during an interview or due diligence it could help convince the interviewer that
you know your stuff.  Consider adding it anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-shingling-to-remember-speeches&quot;&gt;Use ‘shingling’ to Remember Speeches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not include entire speeches to remember. Instead. Use overlapped sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example. If you want to remember the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Break this out into three cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A: Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q: Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A: We are met on a great battle-field of that war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q: We are met on a great battle-field of that war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A: We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help you connect the parts without having to choke on a massive card with the entire speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-absurdity-and-keep-it-fun&quot;&gt;Use Absurdity and Keep it Fun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were driving to work and you saw a naked man riding a horse on the side
of the road would you need to remember it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you have to write it down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. It would burn in your mind.  You’d remember this image for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do this for your facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you met a guy and his name is “Mark Nun”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture this guy as an actual nun wearing a nun’s uniform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re never going to forget this guy’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this all the time and it’s a great hack.  You can do this for your cards to by
mapping images with the cards that are absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-extra-fields&quot;&gt;Use Extra Fields&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create an ‘extra’ field with your cards so that you can add notes and pictures
so that when you fail to remember you can get back to the original context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-stories-and-etymology&quot;&gt;Use Stories and Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attach ‘extra’ stories to the material as above but make them stories or use
imagery to remember the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that etymology works VERY well for learning languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example.  The German word for sea is meer which is related ot the English word
marine which is also related to mare (spanish / italian for sea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those connections make it easier to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SR won’t replace the work of actually understanding the material.  This is still
your job.  If you’re still confused on a subject try reading it from different
perspectives of from different authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the above tips to keep moving forward with spaced repetition. Use a tool
like Polar to easily create flashcards and sync them to Anki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you’re also using the right Anki plugins and that you’re using it to
full effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">13 Lucky Tips for using Anki and Spaced Repetition in 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">13 Lucky Tips for using Anki and Spaced Repetition in 2019</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/25/13-lucky-tips-for-using-anki-and-spaced-repetition-2019-index.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="13 Lucky Tips for using Anki and Spaced Repetition in 2019" /><published>2019-05-25T10:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-25T10:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/25/13-lucky-tips-for-using-anki-and-spaced-repetition-2019/index</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/25/13-lucky-tips-for-using-anki-and-spaced-repetition-2019-index.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;13-lucky-tips-for-using-anki-and-spaced-repetition-in-2019&quot;&gt;13 Lucky Tips for using Anki and Spaced Repetition in 2019&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SR won’t replace the work of actually understanding the material.  This is still
your job.  If you’re still confused on a subject try reading it from different
perspectives of from different authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the above tips to keep moving forward with spaced repetition. Use a tool
like Polar to easily create flashcards and sync them to Anki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you’re also using the right Anki plugins and that you’re using it to
full effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">13 Lucky Tips for using Anki and Spaced Repetition in 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Portable Web Documents - An Alternative to PDF based on HTML5 and Web Standards</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/11/portable-web-documents.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Portable Web Documents - An Alternative to PDF based on HTML5 and Web Standards" /><published>2019-05-11T10:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-11T10:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/11/portable-web-documents</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/11/portable-web-documents.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/assets/images/portable-web-documents-scaled.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;portable-web-documents---an-alternative-to-pdf-based-on-html5-and-web-standards&quot;&gt;Portable Web Documents - An Alternative to PDF based on HTML5 and Web Standards&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portable Web Documents are a technology similar to PDFs (Portable Document
Format) implemented in Polar which support offline caching of full HTML
documents, and with (in the future) improved support for video, charts, and
other compelling features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar uses PWDs and PDFs to manage the users reading and allows the user to keep
all documents in a central repository and allows for suspend/resume of reading,
tagging, and annotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkEo5YmNukY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-a-new-document-format&quot;&gt;Why a New Document Format?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PDFs are great and have gotten us pretty far to date but I think their future 
is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re perfect for laying out text and charts in a static format plus
preserving the document long term and of course sending them via email or
storing them in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they also have a few major limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They only support static layouts - not fluid/dynamic layouts that change when
you resize the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t have support for features like video, animated images, interactive charts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have limited form support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Printing HTML pages as PDFs is also difficult as HTML wasn’t designed to be 
paginated and without explicit support for CSS form-feed on certain items 
(large images) the resulting PDF becomes mangled and hard to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;html-in-a-portable-document-format&quot;&gt;HTML in a Portable Document Format?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we could combine the benefits of PDFs with the benefits of HTML content?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML is amazing and supports a lot of compelling features that are not possible 
in PDF but they’re also limited in a few key areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of the resources in your document vanishes it’s effectively broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also be nice to have the ability to cache a page offline in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML pages can (for the most part) be censored.  If your ISP or government orders
a website offline you might be out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;portable-web-documents-to-the-rescue&quot;&gt;Portable Web Documents to the Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar supports a file format called Portable Web Documents (PWDs) (note
internally we still refer to these as PHZs since we’re still in development of a 
finalize document format) which supports the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PWDs are essentially a full HTML document including all dependent resources 
bundled in a zip file archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some associated file formats like WARC and MHTML that attempt to solve
this problem but only really get you about 30-50% of a complete solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WARCs or example can’t actually be loaded properly in Chrome due to chrome’s 
inability to handle service workers elegantly in chrome extensions or to serve
resources directly via request handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Request handlers can only redirect you to a new URL.  They can’t really replace 
content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to cross origin issues and other web complexities it’s better to take the 
entire document, rewrite the URLs and properly handle dependent resources,
and re-bundle into a new layout which bypasses all these technical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;capture-and-storage&quot;&gt;Capture and Storage.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capture is by far the biggest challenge in making PWDs as representing the
original form an intent of the web designer (and the reader) as a document can
sometimes be very challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a PWD we first have to capture it and this requires support from the 
browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now Polar implements capture via Electron.  We allow the user to preview 
the URL then store the data directly into a rewritten PWD image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the web isn’t really static anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t just take the CSS stylesheets and &lt;img /&gt; references and store them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have to look at the &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many toolkits like React actually modify the DOM directly and manipulate and 
redefine CSS styles.  These have to be written correctly or you will break
page load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have to deactivate all scripts and event handlers so that when the 
PWD loads it’s in a neutralized document. You wouldn’t want scripts running due
to potential security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have to think about web fonts, iframes, and potentially extract metadata 
from the page including title, description and possibly microdata so that the 
PWD has the same metadata exposed in its internal metadata manifest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just an abbreviated list of course of some of the challenges.  There are
another 10-20 issues that we have to be careful when creating PWDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have some challenges now that we’re unsure how to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, some iframes only load when they’re visible so we enabled a cheat 
to expand the preview window to trigger them to load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this caused another ugly bug where some websites like to ‘auto-paginate’
so that when you’re at the bottom of a page you’re given a full related article
in the hope that you stay with the site longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are mutually exclusive though.  A solution for one breaks the
solution for the other so we’re stuck in a catch 22 until we have a workaround.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-limitations&quot;&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have some limitations currently which I’d like to lift in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically we only support static layouts. PWDs could also support fully fluid
layouts as well which would be really exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to support caching of video, audio, images, and interactive 
charts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would make PWDs sort of like a ‘young lady’s illustrated primer’ (if you’ve 
ever read Diamond Age) where a book is now fully interactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would also mean that this interactivity would work offline and be fully 
interactive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now Polar is limited to capturing within Electron which means we can’t 
access the user’s cookies and prevents some URLs from loading properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re porting our capture code to our chrome extension to mitigate this and 
this should be fixed shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar wanted something like PWDs so that we can enable some cool features in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first (which we have now actually) is just full offline archival of web
pages to prevent them from being deleted.  If the content is important you don’t
want it to vanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want a way for users to collaborate around web content.  Add
annotations, comments, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ideally don’t want the content to vanish so PWDs allow us to keep it
associated with the users document store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d also like to enable features where users can exchange documents directly 
without relying on the original site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to bypass censorship for documents that might be sensitive 
outside of their host country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to support video, audio, and interactive charting formats. Video
is a bit difficult as we need to determine how to stream and store the video 
within the compressed archive and stream it efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plan is to use web workers and service workers to decompress it in a 
background thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactive charts and spreadsheets are also compelling but I don’t want to just
enable raw Javascript support.  It might be possible that something like WASM
could solve this by putting the controls in a sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need a strategy to preserve teh fonts long term.  Right now we don’t
store the fonts along with the PWD because they can increase the size by about
2x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be nice for a system like Polar to have sort of a shared CDN so that
fonts are only stored once but this creates problems with dependencies which 
aren’t ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-with-portable-web-documents&quot;&gt;Working with Portable Web Documents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to play with the current version of PWDs download Polar and take
it for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now you can view them in the webapp but can’t create them so you need to
download the desktop version of Polar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re planning on fixing this issue in the next big refactor to embed the
capture process in our chrome extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once created the captured document is stored within Polar as a normal document 
just like any PDF doc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get all the normal Polar features including tagging, annotation, flashcard
creation, cloud sync, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any feedback please jump on our Discord or create a github issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Polar 1.19 Released With Area Highlights and Updated Annotations View</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/10/polar-1-19-0-with-area-highlights.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polar 1.19 Released With Area Highlights and Updated Annotations View" /><published>2019-05-10T10:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-10T10:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/10/polar-1-19-0-with-area-highlights</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/10/polar-1-19-0-with-area-highlights.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;polar-119-released-with-area-highlights-and-updated-annotations-view&quot;&gt;Polar 1.19 Released With Area Highlights and Updated Annotations View&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar 1.19 has been a lot of work but it’s finally out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t updated Polar in a while make sure you’re on the latest version 
by going to Help | About or Help | Check for Updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few we want to highlight about this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;area-highlights&quot;&gt;Area Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Area highlights are now shown in the sidebar and updated and resized while you
drag the area highlight box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was frequently requested by our users and allows you to select mathematical
figures and illustrations for annotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid img-shadow&quot; src=&quot;/assets/screenshots/1-19-sidebar.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;updated-annotations-view&quot;&gt;Updated Annotations View&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve updated the annotations view to show preview annotations and a better view
of each annotation including showing area highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid img-shadow&quot; src=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/assets/screenshots/annotations-view.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;color-selector&quot;&gt;Color Selector&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s now an advanced color selector for highlights and this expands us to 12
different colors.  We’re going to expand the palette in the future but this is
already a step in the right directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically we support any RGB value but we’re limiting the colors you can
select for now just to make the UI simpler and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid img-shadow&quot; src=&quot;/assets/screenshots/1-19-colors.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance-improvements&quot;&gt;Performance Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also implemented some more major performance improvements when working
with larger documents and larger sets of annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;native-pdf-handling-in-web-extension-disabled&quot;&gt;Native PDF Handling in Web Extension Disabled&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had to remove the native PDF handling in our web extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature automatically previewed and added a PDF to the Polar webapp while
browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to disable it due to cross domain security issues we weren’t able to fix.
This might be enabled again in a future version of Polar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Polar 1.19 Released With Area Highlights and Updated Annotations View</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Polar 1.18.0 Released</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/25/polar-1-18-0.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polar 1.18.0 Released" /><published>2019-04-25T10:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-04-25T10:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/25/polar-1-18-0</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/25/polar-1-18-0.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;polar-1180-released&quot;&gt;Polar 1.18.0 Released&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release mostly focused on improving stability
and implementing a few key UI features.  This
upgrades us to Electron 5.x which as needed for
some users who were experiencing severe latency
using Polar on Linux.  We also resolve a key issue
with non-atomic writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes a good chunk of the new sharing
functionality but it’s not enabled yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Big upgrade to latest version of Electron. Electron v5.0.0, Chromium v73.0.3683.119, Node v12.0.0, v8 v7.3.492.27-electron.0. This should hopefully fix a major latency issue some users were seeing on Ubuntu/Linux.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Major performance fix on large PDFs.  Scrolling should be dramatically improved.  There's still a small latency issue we're seeing but already performance is dramatically improved.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enabled atomic writes again for all platforms.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Filtering for tags now lists the tags alphabetically

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right click on text highlight now add 'scroll into view'

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Upgraded to latest version of Typescript 3.4.3

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed regression where progress wasn't being updated when progress messages were being sent from the renderer process.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed bug which resorted in two file uploads to firebase while cloud sync was operational. For large files this was very painful and resorted in 2x data being uploaded.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed bug where the UI would break when both filtering and removing tags on a document that was visible.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased the sidebar a bit to accommodate updating comments without overflow of the summernote bar.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the same account widget on web + desktop now.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document is under construction and still evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;polar-mission-statement-and-design-for-a-personal-knowledge-repository&quot;&gt;Polar Mission Statement and Design for a Personal Knowledge Repository&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar has a broad mission statement to provide high quality tools for document
annotation, management of documents (tagging, storage, etc) and sharing of 
content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a great deal of overlap in the technical requirements needed for these
features so Polar provides a great deal of functionality to provide a
comprehensive personal knowledge repository and distributed content management
platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;roadmap&quot;&gt;Roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the roadmap for &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/10/Roadmap-Q2-Q3-2019.html&quot;&gt;Q2/Q3/Q4 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roadmap living document so please check back over time to see how it evolves
especially as new features are released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-cases&quot;&gt;Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar focuses on a number of key use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core is document management which provides about 70% of the technical
complexity and allows us to re-use this infrastructure for the other use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each additional use case builds upon but shares the core functionality to avoid
technical complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;document-management&quot;&gt;Document Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document management is used by nearly all additional layers within Polar.  This
includes basic functionality like adding documents, supporting multiple formats,
storing metadata (title, author, etc) and handles replication, document
integrity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functionally, this includes features like tagging, flagging, archiving, updating
metadata, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;incremental-reading&quot;&gt;Incremental Reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allows the user to keep track of their position using pagemarks, update their
pagemarks as they read documents, find new documents to read, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also keep track of core stats including number or documents read per day, etc
to encourage the user to hit their reading goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;Annotation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supports text and area highlighting, comments, flashcards, etc. The user can
attach annotations directly to documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annotations are top level metadata and can be exported, copied, and shared 
between users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;document-sharing-and-collaboration&quot;&gt;Document Sharing and Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document sharing allows others to view and share documents you’re reading, and annotating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a key Polar function as we want to test collaborative sharing to improve
knowledge retention using flashcards, and annotations to allow users who are 
sharing the same documents to actively collaborate towards a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, users could collaboratively build flashcards, add video, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could also use this to automatically suggest flashcards for users of 
documents that are being shared with Polar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way you could add a text-book and have pre-built flashcards already 
compiled and easily added with one click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bibliography-management&quot;&gt;Bibliography Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is primarily used for the scientific community and involves lookup of
document metadata via DOI, preserving extended metadata including author
information, and supports exporting selected documents as a bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;web-archival&quot;&gt;Web Archival&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annotating web content is irrelevant if the document can be deleted by the site
thereby invalidating your annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar supports storing web content offline supporting annotations against
content that may or may not be deleted (or updated) by the original site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan on extending this use case to both improve archival in general but also 
support more transparent archives that seem like real web pages within your web 
browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also intend on supporting annotations for content which isn’t necessarily
cached.  This functionality should allow Polar to be used by more users as it
should be much easier to annotate content when it’s just a native web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spaced-repetition-and-flashcard-management&quot;&gt;Spaced Repetition and Flashcard Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having all your reading at your fingertips is pointless if it’s quickly
forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar currently implements spaced repetition by supporting easy flashcard
creation and attaching these to text/area highlights directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flashcards can then be sync’d directly to Anki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tend to continue supporting Anki for power users for the forseeable future
but also want to support basic spaced repetition within Polar directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help people who aren’t Anki power users get started with SR without 
having to commit to Anki, add the plugin, create an account for sync there, 
install the app on their phone, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5d-internet&quot;&gt;5D Internet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar provides a five dimensional (5D) web platform.  We assert that the current
Internet is three-dimensional (3D) with traditional pages and links forming
nodes, edges and building a graph representation of the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re adding the following dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fourth-dimension-time&quot;&gt;Fourth Dimension: Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar supports a content addressable storage scheme where documents are 
represented by their hash, not URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to store web pages in portable web archive formats (bundled as 
one document) which can be stored in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows users to lookup content in their personal repository and have 
multiple copies of the document based on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When connected this provides for an Internet-scale Internet Archive whereby 
users are individually archiving portions of the Internet. [^internet-scale-archiving]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fifth-dimension-annotation&quot;&gt;Fifth Dimension: Annotation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can annotate documents in Polar including adding text and area highlights,
comments, and flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data is valuable to the individual but also to the web community at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO: Expand on this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;federated-data&quot;&gt;Federated Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying Polar data model is not specific to any type of network or 
storage infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-standards&quot;&gt;Beyond standards:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web standards are only one part of what we’re trying to address.  Without 
millions of users using Polar as a integral part of our workflow we will not be
successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end we have to have to focus on growth, UI/UX, support, mobile, and 
accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;corporate-and-non-profit-setup&quot;&gt;Corporate and Non-Profit Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will effectively be two organizations setup to support Polar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PolarOrg will support Polar as an Open Source project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PolarCom will sell cloud storage, private team sharing, and additional premium 
features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s our goal that the vast majority of users using Polar will use the platform 
for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re trying to target roughly 95% of users on Polar will not pay and will be 
on a freemium model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for Polar to be competitive there must be an economic component to 
continue funding development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, we risk our ideas and technology being stolen by other companies who
wouldn’t aggressively support the rights (and goals) of our user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-rights&quot;&gt;User Rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar wants to aggressively support the rights of our user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not interested in doing anything evil.  Without your trust we believe 
this will hurt our mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes but is not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-portability&quot;&gt;Data Portability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to easily access your data in easy to work with file formats
and export to 3rd party services at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-data-is-your-data&quot;&gt;You Data is Your Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar will never attempt to take exclusive ownership of your data and will only 
pursue reasonable rights to access your data for your use or the use of our data
partners (cloud service infrastructure) when you give us access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar will require non-exclusive rights to have access to your data when using
cloud services including sync to mobile, web, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may also engage in data partnerships which will be disclosed and will only 
do so for the benefits of our user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, we’re not interested in doing anything evil and will only use your 
data for your benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;encryption&quot;&gt;Encryption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will make reasonable attempts at making encrypting your data when reasonable
and at rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also investigating private encrypted end-to-end datastores for private 
and sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;desktop-only&quot;&gt;Desktop-only&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have every intention to continue to support desktop-only and offline-only 
usage where your data is not sync’d to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If cloud-only features are built (for example full-text search) we will not 
force uses to use cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;federation&quot;&gt;Federation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federation allows Polar to tie in different backend storage providers which 
could have different properties, security and privacy features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar supports federation through the concept of Datastores which provides a 
high level interface for reading and writing data, subscribing to events, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently Polar supports three datastores:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disk&quot;&gt;Disk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provides a local storage for the desktop app and allows user to read and
write data without any major privacy considerations inherent with cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;firebase&quot;&gt;Firebase&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stores data in Google Firebase to provide cloud functionality including web
and mobile support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud&quot;&gt;Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provides a hybrid between Disk+Firebase for the desktop cloud sync across devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-datastores&quot;&gt;Future Datastores&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar provides for a Datastore interface which means we can easily implement
new technologies for data storage in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filecoin is an example of an attractive Datastore which we might implement in 
the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;long-term-archival&quot;&gt;Long-Term Archival&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the importance of Polar data we’re committed to verifying that documents
stored in Polar are preserved long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This include selecting reliable file formats and using web standards as much as 
possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[^internet-scale-archiving] At some point we might allow users to share documents
but there are privacy concerns we have to address here as web documents served
to users might have PII data embedded within them and we also have to comply
with local laws as well as be respectful of user privacy.  Initially this ]
functionality won’t be enabled but it’s a sub-project we’d like to pursue in 
the future and might be possible for some fraction of the documents indexed 
when we can identify that they have zero PII.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Polar Initial Crowdfunding Campaign</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/11/Polar-Initial-Crowdfunding-Campaign.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polar Initial Crowdfunding Campaign" /><published>2019-04-11T06:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-04-11T06:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/11/Polar-Initial-Crowdfunding-Campaign</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/11/Polar-Initial-Crowdfunding-Campaign.html">&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m Kevin Burton, the creator of Polar and I need your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past six months I’ve been working on a project to address the problems 
with the current Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar is a new type of app which helps you build a personal knowledge repository 
and keeps all your reading in one place.  It allows you to annotate all your 
documents including highlighting and manage them with tags and notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar also supports advanced features like spaced repetition (so you never 
forget anything again) and web archival so you can view a document forever even 
if it’s deleted on the original site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it’s the starting ramp for a more long term vision around 
content sharing and knowledge collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;help-keep-polar-open-source&quot;&gt;Help Keep Polar Open Source&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll touch upon this in a minute but Polar is something I’ve been thinking about for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put - I want to reboot the Internet and take it to a time when data and knowledge was shared more freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar is the platform I’m building to enable this vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see Polar as another layer on top of the existing Internet which includes easy content sharing, annotations, and archival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end I’m starting a crowdfunding campaign to keep Polar open source and really put the project into overdrive - and I need your support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we’re going to raise twenty five thousand dollars from our current user base over the next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We polled our users and asked them what they would be willing do donate and the average was twenty seven dollars, and of course we have thousands of users - so I think this is a reasonable goal.
Now of course, if you’d like do donate more than $27 don’t let me stop you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also going to allow donors to convert their donations to Polar Premium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a link below to the crowdfunding campaign and also one directly in Polar when you’re ready to donate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve raised this initial round, we’re then going to use that momentum to raise $150k from the Internet as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly through a system like Kickstarter or Indiegogo but we’re still investigating our options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should get us through the next 6-9 months and allow us apply for grants to continue supporting development over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grant application process itself can take 3-6 months but the funding could be much larger and allow us to build something really special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-your-support-will-help-polar&quot;&gt;How Your Support Will Help Polar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money will help us improve usability, reliability and focus on feature requests from our user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we’re planning on adding mobile support including iOS and Android and improving our user interface (including a dark mode).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also going to implement a new viewer to support most popular document formats including ePub and Mobi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly we’re going to focus on team sharing and collaboration.  These are two major features of Polar we haven’t shipped yet but they’re the ones I’m most excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot under the surface of Polar that you haven’t seen yet.  Mostly architectural work but I think we’re really close to something amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve included links below to our roadmap if you’re interested in exactly what we’d like to accomplish..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long term goal is to have Polar financially self sufficient but in order to get there we need more time to expand our initial user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;freemium-model&quot;&gt;Freemium Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar will be funded by a freemium model with 95% of users using Polar for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I want to continue to keep Polar Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s vital that a tool that holds your personal knowledge repository is built on a foundation that you can trust isn’t going to simply vanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar’s primary funding long term will be supported by sales of Polar premium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will always support using Polar as Open Source and users can build from source code directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re will also have free versions of Polar which will be very easy to install and without annoying ads or nagging you to constantly upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;premium-versions&quot;&gt;Premium Versions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium versions of Polar designed to be very affordable - $4.99 per month - about the price of a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we haven’t generated enough value for you that you wouldn’t buy me a cup of coffee I think we’re doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve included a rough feature breakdown so you can see what features we intend on charging for at each level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funds we raise will primarily be used to allow me to concentrate on Polar but also bring in additional developers who are more skilled in specific areas including UI, design and React development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;polar-is-important&quot;&gt;Polar is Important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar is an important project for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very passionate about open content and open source and have devoted the last 20 years of my life to fighting for the open web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was one of the inventors of RSS and podcasting and helped create many projects within the Apache Software Foundation including Apache Maven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last ten years I’ve been running a search company I started named Datastreamer which is a petabyte-scale search engine which I built to index large scale web content on behalf of our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m deeply troubled with the way the Internet is becoming more and more locked up behind walled gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in the middle of a data war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies like Facebook, and Elsevier want to lock up the web and science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But knowledge dies without oxygen. Science literally can’t work without active peer review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also something that directly impacts education as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College has become a bubble with students taking on hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt just to finish their degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of textbooks alone has increased 1000% in the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s sad is that we’re losing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook made 53 billion dollars last year.  By comparison, Wikimedia, which shares their data openly, raised $100M in donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means Facebook made 530x more than Wikimedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s a bit of an apples to oranges comparison but the challenge is that strictly non-profit organizations generally tend to lag behind for-profit corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Twain once said that by the time the truth is out of bed a lie is half-way around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel the same about open and closed data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closed data models have the potential for such massive revenues that open data just lags behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar is more of a long term vision around distributed content and knowledge sharing which I think can break down these walled gardens and reboot the web to a time when content and knowledge was shared more freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I’m so focused on Polar becoming economically self sufficient is that large organizations like Facebook have such a massive amount of cash compared to non-profits like Wikimedia that this puts us at a major disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want Polar to be able to stand by itself and have the capital needed to reboot the Internet but at the same time not infringe on the rights of our user base or lock up portions of the Internet the way other companies have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edmund Burke said that for evil to win is for good men to do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an uphill battle - but we’re in this together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all your support.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Polar Roadmap for Q2 and Q3 2019</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/10/Roadmap-Q2-Q3-2019.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polar Roadmap for Q2 and Q3 2019" /><published>2019-04-10T06:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-04-10T06:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/10/Roadmap-Q2-Q3-2019</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/10/Roadmap-Q2-Q3-2019.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/assets/images/long-road-scaled.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;polar-roadmap-for-q2-and-q3-2019&quot;&gt;Polar Roadmap for Q2 and Q3 2019&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write up a quick blog post for the features I’d like to see in 
Q2 and Q3 2019 for you guys to review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;q2-2019&quot;&gt;Q2 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initial version of sharing.  Single document only with public URL (public or private only)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Area highlights with support for annotations and storing them as screenshots along with the document as binary attachments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advanced sharing with teams and user to user + groups a month later&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mobile PWA supported to use Polar on iOS and Android&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polar bundled in app stores directly&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Native Flashcard support without having to need Anki&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for bibliographic information stored in Polar for scientific usage&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full team sharing / collaboration including protected documents across teams and realtime collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firefox extension support&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web app out of preview (and fast!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More colors for highlights&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Binary attachments required for area highlights&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actively engage the user to encourage reading progress via integrated reading tracking (partially implemented today)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Webpack refactor to make our app much smaller &amp;lt;1MB download size on mobile&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comments + Notes + Flashcards directly on the document&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New annotation bar so that user can add comments and flashcards without having to use the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thumbnails for documents&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All CSS embedded in thin web archives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initial UI / UX re-design&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better key bindings along with documentation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latex (math) in comments and flashcards&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DOI lookup provided by unpaywall API.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extended metadata support with metadata ‘profiles’ so that they can be merged&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Search documents on arxiv and import automatically&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bulk import from directories recursively on install&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New icon / logo&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More documentation improvements&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure out a solution + UI for hierarchical tags. Many users have requested
this and I think we can do this via our normal tag mechanism and just need to 
figure out how to fix the UI for this to handle it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comments and annotations should themselves support tags not just inherit the 
tag for the book with which they’re associated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;q3-2019&quot;&gt;Q3 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New document viewer which supports ePub, and Mobi document formats&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark mode implemented once we’re on a new document viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full-text search in cloud but possibly in the standlone desktop version as well&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plugin API for desktop applications&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic REST API for local desktop app for basic operations such as adding files and updating metadata for integration with 3rd party apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Active Capture where the chrome extension automatically saves content while you browse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web annotations without having to capture documents offline but support documents 
which are just URLs references stored in polar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Capture directly within the browser using the chrome extension which won’t  require the desktop app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Annotations attached to shingles not based on absolute positioning.  Right now
our annotation model positions an annotation at a specific place in on the page
at an x,y coordinate offset.  This won’t work with fluid web layout or normal 
web pages and possibly not with ePub so we need a system based on position the 
annotations around text.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Import from Pocket, Zotero, Mendeley (if possible), Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distributed and real-time annotations with federation when using document sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usability improvements to document viewer thanks to new architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for note taking without having to have a document backing the note.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for feeds of content and edge aggregated data streams similar to RSS feeds&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for thin and fat captures with web archives. Right now we support thin
content with just the CSS but we should also support images as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tabbed browsing for desktop edition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More documentation improvements&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;q4-2019&quot;&gt;Q4 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rest API using OpenID to authenticate with the webapp and provide access to a 
users data with 3rd party APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pricing&quot;&gt;Pricing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the above features may fall under the following pricing model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has recently started performing reviews/code audits on any chrome
extension that requests the &lt;all_urls&gt; permissions.&lt;/all_urls&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand the need to audit the code for safety since this is a 
very specific use case and apps could (and have) abused this permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that they take 1 week to audit your code!  This isn’t just for 
code changes but &lt;strong&gt;ANY&lt;/strong&gt; change even if you just change a &lt;em&gt;typo&lt;/em&gt; in your app 
description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 3rd change we’ve made and each time it’s taken about a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just added some images to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polar-pdf-web-and-documen/jkfdkjomocoaljglgddnmhcbolldcafd&quot;&gt;Polar Chrome Extension&lt;/a&gt; and
this ended up triggering a full 1 week review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to add a video and perform some other changes but this means that I now
need to wait ANOTHER week for that to be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bypass-via-activetab&quot;&gt;Bypass via ActiveTab&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need this permission because Polar needs to add CORS headers to allow it 
to add PDFs to your document repository while you browse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way if you come across a cool research paper you can easily add it to Polar
and start highlighting and taking notes on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes it super easy to stumble upon a URL and then easily add it to your 
reading list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some developers can bypass this via extensive auditing with the ActiveTab
permission but it doesn’t apply to Polar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;banning-obfuscated-code&quot;&gt;Banning Obfuscated Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this might be related to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-to-no-longer-allow-chrome-extensions-that-use-obfuscated-code/&quot;&gt;code obfuscation ban&lt;/a&gt; 
but apparently this is not the case since it also impacts images and text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chilling-effect&quot;&gt;Chilling Effect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrome has about 80% of the market so this impacts a LOT of developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t take more than a few hours to update my app.  If I’m changing the 
code and it’s a 5 line diff it should be published immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize Google doesn’t make any money here but developers can always use 
other platforms so it’s in their best interest to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, it takes Microsoft eight hours to publish a new version of our 
app to their app store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope someone at Google see this posts and we see some sort of resolution 
to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Google Killing Chrome Extensions with 1 Week Publishing Delays</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting Hacker News’d Twice - Lessons Learned for Entrepreneurs</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/02/getting-hacker-news-lessons-for-entrepreneurs.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting Hacker News'd Twice - Lessons Learned for Entrepreneurs" /><published>2019-04-02T06:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-04-02T06:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/02/getting-hacker-news-lessons-for-entrepreneurs</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/04/02/getting-hacker-news-lessons-for-entrepreneurs.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/assets/images/hackernews-stats.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-hacker-newsd-twice---lessons-learned-for-entrepreneurs&quot;&gt;Getting Hacker News’d Twice - Lessons Learned for Entrepreneurs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt; featured on Hacker News three times in the last six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been interesting to say the least and I wanted to write up my thoughts here
to share my lessons learned with other entrepreneurs and hackers who might be 
launching apps or having their site featured on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read our original posts here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18219960&quot;&gt;Show HN: Polar – an offline web browser with annotations and tagging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/2019/03/01/polar-personal-knowledge-repository.html&quot;&gt;Polar as a Personal Knowledge Repository&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19294799&quot;&gt;Hacker News Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the upside.  The traffic. If you get featured on the front page of HN
you can expect a nice torrent of traffic for about 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb from my experience is that you can expect from 12-15k 
users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;traffic-from-oct-2018&quot;&gt;Traffic from Oct 2018&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/hacker-news-traffic-10-2018.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first big HN splash.  This provided a great deal of validation that Polar 
could really help with people to manage their reading and that other people
were experiencing the same pain that I had when dealing with books and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;traffic-from-march-2019&quot;&gt;Traffic from March 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/hacker-news-traffic-03-2019.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March you can see we’ve reduced our bounce rate and I think we’ve been 
improving the app across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially we were just a basic MVP and now we have some really impressive 
features which help users decide to actually give us a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;insanely-smart&quot;&gt;Insanely Smart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside of the HN crowd is that they’re insanely smart.  Seriously.  Expect
VCs, hackers, students, PhDs, entrepreneurs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can provide awesome feedback for your app/project/startup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had some really amazing suggestions that we wouldn’t have received 
otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside?  They’re insanely smart - so they’re not the typical user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One trick you have to learn is when to discard their advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather once said the great thing about advice is that you don’t have to 
take it - and I think that applies here as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their suggestions might work GREAT for &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; use case but it might not work
out well for your project - especially if you want to build something more
mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I think that the vast majority of their advice is valuable and it’s 
great to get an initial user base using your product - even if they’re early 
adopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mindset&quot;&gt;Mindset&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re working on a project and think HN could benefit make sure you approach
them with the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t spam.  It just won’t work.  They have a spam force-field.  It won’t get
through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually &lt;em&gt;contribute&lt;/em&gt; and find a valuable way to give back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Polar we’re a bit lucky as they’re the target market.  Polar is a tool for
people to manage their reading.  If you read a lot of research papers, books,
web pages, etc and want to keep that material manageable forever then Polar
might be the tool for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re a tool for alpha geeks and HN is definitely the right crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if your app isn’t a typical HN tool you can find another way to benefit
from their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take whatever you’re working on and make it interesting. Find something 
that provides value and you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-it-easy-for-them-to-participate&quot;&gt;Make it easy for them to participate.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more tools you have ahead of time to make it easy for them to give you 
feedback the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to harness the initial feedback and help them contribute to your 
community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to setup chat or a discussion forum so they can easily jump on and get you
their initial impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a ton of users submit github issues or jump on our Discord group every 
time we’ve been on HN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;harness-the-feedback-long-term&quot;&gt;Harness the feedback long term&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the main area I messed up on in the past.  We had no way to harness the
HN feedback and crowd long term!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had about 30k visitors and only about 1500 installed our app.  The problem we
had is that it’s a desktop app that you have to download and install it locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I’m starting to learn that the conversion rate here is insanely 
low.  Something like 5% - not very impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve since learned my lesson and Polar has relaunched as a webapp.  We now have
three ways to capture them long term after they hit the site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, when they sign up on the site we capture their email and (optionally) add
them to our mailing list.  If the app doesn’t work out for them initially it
might in the future and this way we can blast out an email when we have an
update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we now have an advanced Chrome extension that you can install which 
adds a preview feature for PDFs and allows you to easily install it via just 
clicking an ‘Add to Polar’ button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they don’t initially get that “AHA” moment from the webapp, they might in the
future once they install the extension and they discover a PDF that they want to
read.  They might be in more of a mindset to read and this might help them
understand the app a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, now that Polar is a webapp, they can try it much faster.  They can be 
up and running in &amp;lt; 1 second.  Just login and enter their credentials and 
they’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-meta-experiment&quot;&gt;The Meta Experiment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is actually a meta experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this is actually the 3rd time we’re going to make it on HN. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took what I learned from the first two times and implemented the changes to 
Polar that I think will contribute to significant growth and make it easier for 
our users to get that “AHA” moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this actually applies across the board not just on HN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having a webapp really hurt us and prevented people from just playing with
it for a bit instead of downloading a complicated app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least that’s my working hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll see what happens this time.  I’ve been putting a ton of time and effort 
into Polar to get it launched - working 24/7 basically and I think I’m very very
close to being at the sweet spot in terms of usability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
