&lt;h1 id=&quot;building-polars-productmarket-fit-engine&quot;&gt;Building Polar’s Product/Market Fit Engine&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past month or so I’ve been revamping Polar’s product-market-fit engine to help understand our users and to
prioritize feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it’s helping me build a product for the long term based on science rather than whim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be great if we could build a engine that could systematically build a product roadmap but also help ensure 
that we’re building a product that our users actually want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-field-of-dreams-fallacy&quot;&gt;The Field of Dreams Fallacy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOPTByHw5RA&quot;&gt;Field of Dreams&lt;/a&gt;, (spoiler alert…) the protagonist hears a
voice that tells him to build a baseball field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the movie, after the field is built (and spending all of his family’s money in the process), thousands of people
arrive out of nowhere, bringing in money to help save his farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, this almost never happens.  Apps that explode and take off virally are very rare and the most successful
viral apps are actually the 4th or 5th attempt by the founders to get something to take off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth of the matter is that it’s very difficult to build a highly successful app and when you do there might
not actually be a customer acquisition model that actually works well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many startups and open source projects have an amazing product but can’t find users because they don’t have an
affordable customer acquisition channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we solve this problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;productmarket-fit&quot;&gt;Product/Market Fit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product/Market fit (PMF) is the idea that you’ve both found a market (a pool of users that want to buy and use your 
product) as well as a product that resonates with them and actually solves their problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the holy grail.  If you can nail this you’re going to have happy customers/users.  They’re going to tell their 
friends, you’re going to find new users just by word of mouth, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, they won’t churn.  Specifically, they’re actually going to use your product and keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churn is the idea that people check out your product, then never return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to reduce churn is to build something that people actually want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the PMF engine comes into play.  It provides a scientific framework for listening to customers and 
bootstrapping to PMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;using-science-and-statistics-to-hit-productmarket-fit&quot;&gt;Using Science and Statistics to Hit Product/Market Fit.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a scientist and it’s how I see the world. If I can’t quantify something with statistics I can’t 
improve it over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A scientific approach to actually running a company/startup/project is going to be profoundly superior than just throwing
darts at a board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theleanstartup.com/&quot;&gt;The Lean Startup&lt;/a&gt; was the first book that I read that really put this at the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/&quot;&gt;Superhuman pushed this idea further&lt;/a&gt; with
the idea of actually using user feedback in a more scientific manner to nail PMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central focus is to improve your features set for users who already love (and preferably pay for) your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;make-something-people-love&quot;&gt;Make Something People Love&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html&quot;&gt;Paul Graham’s observation&lt;/a&gt; that you should first make a small group of users love you is a very important insight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you can’t expect to hit that right away. Initially you
have to choose between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users, or satisfying a subset of the needs of
all potential users. Take the first. It’s easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise. And perhaps more importantly,
it’s harder to lie to yourself. If you think you’re 85% of the way to a great product, how do you know it’s not 70%? Or
10%? Whereas it’s easy to know how many users you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users that are insanely happy with your product are more likely to recommend it to others, give you money, give you good reviews, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users are who are only moderately interested in your product are going to provide you significantly less value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re significantly less likely to upgrade, less likely to be loyal if your product has a small issue, more likely to
stop using your product, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;talk-to-your-users&quot;&gt;Talk to your Users&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build out a meaningful set of user interview questions to gain important insight about your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; to your users.  No email.  Talk to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Polar I setup a &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt; form so that they could just pick a slot. I then tied it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/33W6LsC&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; so
that each user could pick a time that works for them and that worked out well with my schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then setup a script to send off 10 emails at a time to our users inviting them to time that works for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that since only about 10% agree to a user interview I just keep sending out emails until my calendar has enough
user interviews scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to target about 3-5x per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-polls&quot;&gt;User Polls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK.  I know I said to talk to your users.  But don’t JUST talk to them.  Some don’t have time but still have valuable 
feedback.  Take a modified version of your user interview questions and create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://referral.typeform.com/mteHQSg&quot;&gt;Typeform&lt;/a&gt; that
users can complete in less than 1 minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a lot of open ended questions.  Ask for data points too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;avoiding-survivor-bias&quot;&gt;Avoiding Survivor Bias&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main issues is that most of the people who reply to our survey’s tend to be people that really like Polar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this doesn’t help me solve issues that are causing potential users to churn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find this subset of users and reach out to them directly and talk to them. Pay them if you have too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be valuable insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;feature-prioritization&quot;&gt;Feature Prioritization&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where the main value comes from and that’s customized feature priority to help you nail PMF and make your users
insanely happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the most important part though - do not worry about making everyone happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of your users aren’t going to like the app. Maybe you just don’t work well on their favorite platform. Maybe you’re
missing a key feature that’s not really on your roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter.  If they don’t value your product don’t value their features request and feedback as highly as other users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do you’re going to be optimizing for building a &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; product and we need to focus on landing a beachhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to figure out some subset of users that are insanely addicted to your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-difficulty&quot;&gt;Technical Difficulty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all features are equal in terms of complexity.  Some you can bang out in 1-2 hours and others require months
of planning and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This needs to be factored into our planning or we might be working on the wrong things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;customer-demand&quot;&gt;Customer Demand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now score the customer demand but segment based on how they feel about your product.  There are a few ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest is to segment. FIXME..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is slightly controversial but sometimes it’s important to ignore your customers and implement a feature that will
have greater long term impact on the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you have two features, but one of those features causes dramatically increased user retention, go with 
this second feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These type of features will yield higher revenue in the long term which means you can have the financial resources
to build out the rest of your feature set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;polar-150---spaced-repetition-better-incremental-reading-and-plans-for-20&quot;&gt;Polar 1.50 - Spaced Repetition, Better Incremental Reading and Plans for 2.0&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar 1.50 was just released and will be rolling out to everyone in a staged over the next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the biggest releases we’ve had in a long time and will be the foundation for 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-in-this-release&quot;&gt;What’s In This Release&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s get into what we’ve changed in this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improved-incremental-reading-and-spaced-repetition&quot;&gt;Improved Incremental Reading and Spaced Repetition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this release we conducted about 30 user interviews and one clear trend was that users needed and wanted a
better mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous version of our mobile app was alpha at best and was just meant to be a standby until we had it fully ported
over to mobile and tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to take longer than I had hoped but dove tails into the long term of Polar being a spaced repetition platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve rebuild the mobile app and integrated native flashcard review into Polar directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anki functionality and sync will keep improving of course and will not be deprecated.  In fact, we have a few more 
features we’re working on for Anki and will be enabling them in the coming weeks via feature flags at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s now a ‘start review’ button in the annotations view that allows you to review your flashcards directly in Polar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;incremental-reading&quot;&gt;Incremental Reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this we now have incremental reading and review of your annotations on mobile via spaced repetition schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intervals for incremental reading are longer for flashcards (1d, 4d, and 8d) and the system was designed to work
well with review on the mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-mobile-app-redesign&quot;&gt;New Mobile App Redesign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the full mobile app redesign the new experience should be completely smooth and ready for production use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to improve it a bit more to work completely offline.  Firebase has some amazing cache/offline-first features 
where queries and data can be written and re-sync’d when you come back online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has interesting opportunities for reviewing your reading and flashcards when not connected to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stats-for-flashcards&quot;&gt;Stats for Flashcards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-dark rounded&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rjhlQLY.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version now adds stats for flashcards including total completed, queue size, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;paid-on-mobile&quot;&gt;Paid on Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile flashcard review will be a paid feature in 2.0 when on mobile.  It will work for free on the desktop app
but if you want to review on mobile you will need a premium account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;annotation-bar-color-updates&quot;&gt;Annotation Bar color updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annotation bar now has 5 main colors (up from 3) when selecting text for a highlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;only-stable-features&quot;&gt;Only Stable Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to take the position of only enabling stable features from now on. For new users to Polar this was confusing
when they would see something like groups (even if it had a ‘beta’ flag on it) and I want them to have a good initial&lt;br /&gt;
experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on we will be enabling new (and not yet ready) features via feature flags that developers or beta testers 
can turn on manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;documentation-and-website-updates&quot;&gt;Documentation and Website Updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our documentation is being reworked now to update the changes needed for 2.0.  I’m going to try to get more press for 
2.0 so this will mean a lot of new user seeing Polar for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-list-of-changes-in-15010&quot;&gt;Full List of Changes in 1.50.10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Statistics now shown for flashcards when the user is using spaced repetition&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No more hamburger menu in the sidebar.  All options are now flat in the desktop UI and more discoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using proper MacOS system font along with Robot everywhere else including android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New documentation rework and will be improving this long term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Added two more colors to the annotation bar. Was frequently requested by our users so just added it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flashcards now inherit the text of the annotation when being created to avoid double copy / pasting of text.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mobile now a supported platform and designed for spaced repetition.  This will get us moving on mobile until
we can build out a real/full reading platform there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The header and footer in the doc repo is fixed now and don’t move as you scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fixed bug with drag and drop and working with items from the second page of results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flashcard reviewer now integrated along with our normal spaced repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Annotation reviewer spaced repetition system finally integrated into Polar&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More work on mobile including disabling some features when using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Active filters are now light blue so that users know they have filters enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Color and annotation type filters now work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fixed bug with the root folders having the wrong counts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-next-and-plans-for-20&quot;&gt;What’s Next and Plans for 2.0&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release is basically the foundation for 2.0.  There are a few more features / changes to make before 2.0 is ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to improve our documentation a bit more and we have a few more fixes and changes that are still pending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;updated-annotation-sidebar&quot;&gt;Updated Annotation Sidebar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking at improving the annotation sidebar to add features like filtering by text (search basically), tagging documents
directly (vs having to jump back to the document repository), and other options like archiving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;better-pricing-models&quot;&gt;Better Pricing Models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working on better pricing models for students and those outside the United States in developing countries.  Charging
$4.99 per month to someone in India/Laos doesn’t seem fair considering the differing values of currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also investigating yearly accounts as I think there’s a psychological advantage for students to buy in 1-2 year 
increments as it seems many people really dislike monthly payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;better-keyboard-bindings&quot;&gt;Better Keyboard Bindings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re investigating bringing on board better keyboard bindings.  It didn’t make it to this release because we have to
do a big dependency management update (React) and I wanted to get a stable release out the door.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Polar 1.40 - Tags in the sidebar, Drag and Drop Folders, and more!</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/10/24/1-40-Tags-sidebar-drag-and-drop-folders.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polar 1.40 - Tags in the sidebar, Drag and Drop Folders, and more!" /><published>2019-10-24T09:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-10-24T09:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/10/24/1-40-Tags-sidebar-drag-and-drop-folders</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/10/24/1-40-Tags-sidebar-drag-and-drop-folders.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-dark rounded&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HEKJEE2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;polar-140---tags-in-the-sidebar-drag-and-drop-folders-and-more&quot;&gt;Polar 1.40 - Tags in the sidebar, Drag and Drop Folders, and more!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar 1.40 is now available.  This release includes a number of new features upgrades and stability improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I should apologize for the slower release cycle lately.  I’ve been working on a number of internal refactors
to Polar to help us scale moving forward.  Among these was a pretty large refactor into a ‘monorepo’ using submodules
to make Polar much easier to manage moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will enable a number of new features which below.  It’s already improved our speed of development now that we’ve
mostly finished the migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-in-this-release&quot;&gt;What’s In This Release&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s get into what we’ve changed in this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tags-on-the-sidebar&quot;&gt;Tags on the Sidebar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have tags (not just folders) on the sidebar.  You can see the tags and the number of documents with the given
tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also works for the annotation view too and you can see the tag counts there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the tag will load the tag in the right pane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drag-and-drop-of-folders&quot;&gt;Drag and Drop of Folders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now drag and drop documents on to folders or tag.  Dragging the document will add the the folder or tag to the 
dropped document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won’t yet work for annotations as we have to upgrade our viewer for this to happen but it’s on the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fixed-bad-firebase-authentication-bug&quot;&gt;Fixed Bad Firebase Authentication Bug&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fixed an issue with the desktop version of Polar (running on Electron) where it would intermittently fail to 
authenticate to Firebase when trying to sync to cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was really tough to track down and I apologize to anyone bitten by this bug. It would only impact some users and
only some small percentage of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;library-upgrades&quot;&gt;Library Upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve upgraded to the latest versions of firebase, pdfjs, jszip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short/medium term we’re working on improving these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improved-folders&quot;&gt;Improved Folders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many users have been confused with how folders work and in retrospect I can see why.  We shipped with a basic interface
which was somewhat non-standard so it wasn’t really possible to figure out how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to add some UI changes to make this more accessible including a ‘+’ (create folder) button and the ability
to create folders, and then drag files into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stable-groups-release&quot;&gt;Stable Groups Release&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working on improving groups which are only about 80% complete.  I’m hoping that the drag and drop interface will
make them easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m struggling with some UI issues here so my plan is to bring in a designer to help me understand the challenges I
have with making it easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-version-of-capture&quot;&gt;New Version of Capture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working on a redesign of the way web capture works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web capture is the ability for Polar to take a web document in HTML and store it within Polar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many users are reporting that capture fails a significant percentage of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, capture doesn’t currently support adblock, readability, or other chrome/firefox extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new design will allow it to work directly within the extension within the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intention is to target the web extension API which will mean it will work on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t commit to supporting all four major browsers out of the door but that’s the goal.  We have about 90% of our
users on Chrome but Firefox and Safari are definitely important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doi-lookup-and-extended-metadata&quot;&gt;DOI Lookup and Extended Metadata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working on supporting more 3rd party metadata lookup APIs.  Initially we will support just lookup of public
documents via DOI using &lt;a href=&quot;https://unpaywall.org/&quot;&gt;unpaywall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will allow you to enter a DOI, fetch the document into your repository, and store the extended metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also support resolving the metadata if the PDF has a DOI in stored in its metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also serve as the basis for enhanced citation management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long term plans are to support the Pubmed API and the Fatcat API provided by the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thumbnails&quot;&gt;Thumbnails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re planning on adding thumbnail previews for documents added to Polar.  This has been on the agenda for a while now
but is only just now possible due to some complexities regarding thumbnails and snapshots across operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think initially this might only work when cloud-sync is enabled but I’d like to get it to work on the desktop version
of Polar at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;electron-70&quot;&gt;Electron 7.0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to migrate to Electron 7.0 now that it’s out. The major feature here is the updated Chrome backend but there
are some other nice stability improvements here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;freemium-vs-premium&quot;&gt;Freemium vs Premium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working on some other features in the background to the premium version of Polar including full-text search.  Some
of the citation management features will also be premium features like they are in other citation management tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also working on working other ways to get access to Polar premium for students and others in developing nations 
that might not be able to afford these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be talking about these in the next few weeks.  Unfortunately, many of these features just flat out cost money 
including features like cross-device full-text search, OCR, text to speech, and other premium features I’m considering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;upgrading&quot;&gt;Upgrading&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to make sure you’re on the right version of Polar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;web&quot;&gt;Web&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using the web version of Polar you’re probably running the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;desktop&quot;&gt;Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using a desktop app this release will be pushed to all users over the next week. If you’d like to see if
you’re already on the latest version just go to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Help | About&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to upgrade earlier you can go to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Help | Check for Updates&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What’s Next for Offline Web Capture of Web Pages in Polar</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/10/06/Whats-Next-For-Web-Capture.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What's Next for Offline Web Capture of Web Pages in Polar" /><published>2019-10-06T09:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-10-06T09:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/10/06/Whats-Next-For-Web-Capture</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/10/06/Whats-Next-For-Web-Capture.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lLKEfKI.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we shipped Polar we’ve been listening to feedback from our users as to the default behavior and functionality of 
web capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web capture (or just capture) is what we call converting an HTML page to a format that can be persisted and used within
Polar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code started off as an advanced proof of concept but it had a few issues in practice that holds it back from 
perfectly solving the problem of offline web pages as documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we’re working on in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;epub&quot;&gt;EPUB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPUB will become the default format.  Internally, EPUB is just HTML and CSS and if we migrate web capture to use EPUB 
then this means we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; support EPUB as a primary file format in Polar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means less code to debug since everything is EPUB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to work on a converter to take our PHZ format and convert it to EPUB so that existing documents will 
convert in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;based-on-web-extensions&quot;&gt;Based on Web Extensions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to migrate everything to a web extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the native Electron capture will migrate to being completely browser based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to support Chrome, Firefox, and Safari extensions during this process as our Firefox extension is nearly 
finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages here are the ability to use regular chrome extensions like uBlock, Ad Block Pro, Mercury Reader, or Easy Reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new extension will completely bundle the pages resources and send them to the Polar cloud or desktop app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fluid-layout&quot;&gt;Fluid Layout.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new format will not require a fixed document size like the previous version.  This was needed due to the layout
algorithm for placing highlights.  The new version should support placing highlights based on text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One UI change might be that area highlights for HTML documents will anchor to images since the flow can change this 
means that an area you select might move when you resize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mobile-and-tablet-support&quot;&gt;Mobile and Tablet Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve migrated to EPUB as a backend, captured content will work on mobile and tablet devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also going to have capture work on mobile by sending the raw URL to the Polar cloud backend and having it 
perform the capture for you in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way capture will work on all devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lightweight-capture-url-only&quot;&gt;Lightweight Capture (URL only)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also going to work on lightweight capture where we store the URL only.  I think for a lot of users it might not
make sense to store 300k per document as part of Polar so storing just the URL and annotations will mean much 
lower storage requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview-1&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these issues will solve 95% of the initial problems we had with capture and make the entire platform much more
reliable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Future of Polar Cloud Sync</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/10/05/Future-of-Polar-Cloud-Sync.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Future of Polar Cloud Sync" /><published>2019-10-05T09:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-10-05T09:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/10/05/Future-of-Polar-Cloud-Sync</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/10/05/Future-of-Polar-Cloud-Sync.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/assets/images/firebase-sync-scaled.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-future-of-polar-cloud-sync&quot;&gt;The Future of Polar Cloud Sync&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to be changing some features in the ‘local’ mode version of Polar and some new cloud features won’t be 
available in this mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to keep Polar’s local mode as full featured as possible but I’ve decided that this just isn’t possible 
moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New features like full-text search, machine learning, and other features won’t be available in local mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll explain more below but please read the full post if you’re concerned or have any suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar has three modes of operation.  Local, cloud, and web.  These are internal modes and you’ve probably never 
really thought of them before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first install Polar on the desktop it’s local only. No files are written to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you login to cloud on the desktop, it goes into cloud mode and transparently syncs between local and the cloud
so that your local files are synchronized between all your devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web mode is basically just the cloud mode bug without any local support.  It’s what you’re using when you login 
to the webapp or use Polar on tablet or desktop devices.  It has the same features as cloud mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;offline&quot;&gt;Offline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local, cloud, and web modes don’t accurately portray offline functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three modes will work in offline (and disconnected) mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you’re using a tablet, and have Polar installed, and you’ve downloaded a PDF before, you can still open
it again and continue reading and annotating while it’s offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What WILL NOT work is search and some of the features articulated below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;offline-vs-online-features&quot;&gt;Offline vs Online Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most core features of Polar will be designed to work offline.  Firebase itself has support for offline operation which
means our webapp, and mobile and tablet apps will work just fine while offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloud-specific-features&quot;&gt;Cloud-specific Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some features won’t be ported to the desktop mode and will only work in cloud or web mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;local&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;cloud&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;web&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;full-text search&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;online&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;online&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;thumbnails for documents&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;no [1]&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;online&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;online&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;ML features like tags suggested from content&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;online&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;online&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;search for new documents using Arxiv / Pubmed&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;online [2]&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;online&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;online&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Probably not initially but perhaps in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This will use a web service and will run your queries online but the PDFs and metadata will only be stored locally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features like full-text search and other machine learning (ML) features have been requested by our users for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to add these features but they’re very complex and I can’t approach them as I would like adding a new UI button 
or something trivial.  Complex performance issues, scale, power utilization, all factor into this decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;reasoning&quot;&gt;Reasoning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile and tablet support are going to be a big part of Polar’s future.  After talking to our users it’s becoming 
very clear that we’d probably have 50% of our users using these devices if they weren’t locked down to just desktop
and the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by far the primary motivator for implementing these features in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t use Elasticsearch in mobile devices.  We can’t spin up tensor flow on your tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we could the power requirements would be insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of APIs and features we can use with cloud APIs that just aren’t available any other way.  Thumbnails,
text to speech, OCR, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;portability&quot;&gt;Portability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any code based on cloud infrastructure will work across all devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile, tablet, desktop. Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows, Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re using Elasticsearch in the cloud it doesn’t matter which frontend device you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;complexity&quot;&gt;Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting all platforms and operating systems for these features would be completely unworkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we could solve all the above the performance would be abysmal.  Importing a large document set could take 5-15 
minutes when using full-text indexing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Elasticsearch I can index your documents across 100 nodes in parallel and have it done 100x faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feature-set&quot;&gt;Feature Set&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frameworks like Elasticsearch and Tensorflow are very powerful. We might be able to get away with using something else 
but for the most part it’s not going to be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even simple features like language stemming aren’t really well documented in other desktop-only search libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scale&quot;&gt;Scale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I can bring in additional teams to easily manage these services on the backend.  This is going to help
grow the team and make sure you’re a satisfied user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pricing-and-access&quot;&gt;Pricing and Access&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these cloud features will cost money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some ideas on how to keep things more affordable (and free) for students and freemium users but generally
speaking, users with larger repositories will have to pay to use these features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… but believe me, it will be worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unlocking-features&quot;&gt;Unlocking Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some features of Polar may be unlocked in the future and in that case, if you don’t want to use any cloud services, we
will just authenticate you and then allow you to opt out of cloud sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;backups--snapshots&quot;&gt;Backups / Snapshots&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also allow us to support backups and snapshots of your data so that you can restore data directly from the 
cloud.  Google cloud storage is insanely cheap so the plan is to enable a simple export/import mechanism which will 
store your datastore directly on Google Cloud Storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pricing for this is reasonable so we’re planning on taking regular backups for our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;offline-first-and-data-privacy&quot;&gt;Offline First and Data Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We generally support the “offline-first” movement to keep data out of cloud devices but it’s a very complicated subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some users don’t want any of their data in the cloud. Some are just concerned about which data providers are used.&lt;br /&gt;
Some users don’t care at all as long as it’s reasonably secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major issue is data storage location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to improve our usability here by allowing the user to pick a primary location among the available Google 
datacenters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to support the United States and Western Europe.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/locations&quot;&gt;Google’s Datacenters are located here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help our users concerned about where they have their physical data stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We probably won’t have this soon but we’d like to have it done in the near term (3-12 months).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won’t be able to provide any non-Google issues as we’re using their Firebase platform and don’t have plans to move away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;additional-features&quot;&gt;Additional Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud mode enables additional features as well including the ability to sync the URL of your document (or annotations)
to Anki so that the context for a flashcard is available with one click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re just simply not able to implement features like this without some type of cloud backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;default-mode&quot;&gt;Default Mode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future we will encourage users to use the cloud mode by default so that all features are enabled including sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Polar will continue to support local mode into the near future with limited features compared to full cloud
and web mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also going to encourage users to use cloud mode by default moving forward and will also allow you to pick your 
own datacenter and by default pick one closer to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new cloud support we also intend on supporting advanced features like full-text search, machine learning, and 
backups.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Polar Outage- Sept 18 2019</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/09/18/Polar-Outage-Sept-2019.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polar Outage- Sept 18 2019" /><published>2019-09-18T09:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-09-18T09:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/09/18/Polar-Outage-Sept-2019</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/09/18/Polar-Outage-Sept-2019.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;polar-outage--sept-18-2019&quot;&gt;Polar Outage- Sept 18 2019&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an outage last night for Polar cloud sync and our web application which was related to an issue in Google cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users would have been unable to use the web application and cloud sync wouldn’t work properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 2 AM PST Google downgraded all of our accounts due to “activity”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received an email with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Billing was disabled for your project, or The billing account attached to your project was closed”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our accounts were downgraded to the Spark plan (their lowest plan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we figured out what was happening we reverted our billing to blaze (the proper plan) and about ten minutes 
later everything was functioning properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also coincided with a release which was just a coincidence.  Some of our users were saying that Polar was failing
after upgrading but it was just a timing issue.  Upon restart Polar does a full re-sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We apologize or the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still trying to investigate &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this happened as there were no changes on our end and Google shouldn’t have
taken our projects offline.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Polar Outage- Sept 18 2019</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://getpolarized.io/assets/logo/icon.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Minimizing Defection Might be the Solution to the Tragedy of the Commons</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/07/26/Minimizing-Defection-Might-be-the-Solution-to-the-Tragedy-of-the-Commons.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Minimizing Defection Might be the Solution to the Tragedy of the Commons" /><published>2019-07-26T10:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-26T10:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/07/26/Minimizing-Defection-Might-be-the-Solution-to-the-Tragedy-of-the-Commons</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/07/26/Minimizing-Defection-Might-be-the-Solution-to-the-Tragedy-of-the-Commons.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimizing-defection-might-be-the-solution-to-the-tragedy-of-the-commons&quot;&gt;Minimizing Defection Might be the Solution to the Tragedy of the Commons.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being that my background is in CompSci I tend to think about thinks in terms of probabilities, statistics, game theory, 
and distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently made what I think may be a unique observation about a number of social problems that might all be
related to one root cause - defection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might be wrong but would love some feedback.  It’s an exceedingly complicated topic which has been researched for 
hundreds of years so it might be that this observation has been made before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial epiphany came while thinking about two main issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corporations abusing their employees and the need to unionize.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corporations all rushing towards some non-optimal solution in the pursuit of profit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consumers unwilling to purchase products even if purchasing them would fund a product they cared about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my assertion that these are all related to the tragedy of the commons. I’ll just quote from Wikipedia to save you a step:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The tragedy of the commons is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently
 according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users, by depleting or spoiling that
 resource through their collective action. The theory originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist
 William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (also known
 as a “common”) in Great Britain and Ireland.[1] The concept became widely known as the “tragedy of the commons” over a
 century later due to an article written by the American ecologist and philosopher Garrett Hardin in 1968.[2] In this
 modern economic context, commons is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere, oceans,
 rivers, fish stocks, roads and highways, or even an office refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d assert that the tragedy of the commons is actually a more general form of the prisoners dilemma (again, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The prisoner’s dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational
individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a prison term there’s the destruction of some resource and the tragedy of the commons is generalized to more actors.  Usually hundreds to thousands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cheating-and-cynicism&quot;&gt;Cheating and Cynicism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the core issue in the above is defection - the idea that one player can decide to cheat the others for their own
benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FEWER the actors the less probability that there will be defection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a completely hypothetical chart at what I think the rate of defection would look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GYGoVF4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would need to be validated experimentally but I suspect that the probability of cooperation (the opposite of
defection) would be inversely proportional to the size of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would explain fundamental problems with collective action and why systems like communism are doomed to failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know the other person well and trust them, you’re probably not going to defect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you have thousands of people you’re going to be far far less trusting that someone isn’t going to defect and 
screw you over.  Hence &lt;em&gt;you’re&lt;/em&gt; more likely to defect as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a core observation.  The more actors in a class that CAN defect the higher the probability that they WILL defect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This why unions are so hard to form and manage.  There are thousands of people in a company and they all have conflicting
interests.  If they would hold their ground they could achieve their goals but they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason they don’t is game theoretic and hence deterministic.  We won’t ever solve this problem until we reduce
the probability of defection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, the same situation applies to corporations creating externalities (destroying the environment, 
hurting their employees, etc).  They’re essentially forced into this behavior due to defection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company cares about the environment but all your customers care about is price then the companies that have 
a higher priced product will go out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough these customers are also driven by defection.  Why care about the environment when no one else does?  Why
are you the only one who cares?  Why pay $15 a pound for steak when you can just pay $5?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, the optimum solution is always present when N=1.  If there’s just one actor (you) then you’re not
likely to destroy your own property.  The more actors present the higher chance that someone’s going to abuse the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-protocol-for-minimizing-defection&quot;&gt;A Protocol for Minimizing Defection?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we could solve this problem through core changes in our society?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t help thinking that maybe some sort of smart contract could be used here or a system of opt-in benefits and harsh 
punishments for defection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still working through what this would mean but I’ll illustrate some (flawed) ideas below to illustrate some potential 
solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if unions gave perks to employees including job references, health benefits, etc BUT to participate in the union 
you had to put forth a $5k bond.  This could be deducted slowly over time from your paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you defect, the bond is revoked and you lose that money - permanently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll agree that this is a week solution as I mentioned I’m still trying to work on an ideal way to handle this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers could do something similar for corporations as well.  Have reserved payments given out over time but only 
if the companies don’t create any externalities for which the consumer doesn’t approve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these actors function collectively and make decisions as a group these could all be done automatically via simple
majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think regardless, identify the CORE issue here would allow us to keep working towards a goal.  The first step 
towards a solution is realizing the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Minimizing Defection Might be the Solution to the Tragedy of the Commons.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://getpolarized.io/assets/logo/icon.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Polar 1.19.8 Released - Better Payments and Fixes</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/06/02/Polar-1-19-8.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polar 1.19.8 Released - Better Payments and Fixes" /><published>2019-06-02T10:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-06-02T10:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/06/02/Polar-1-19-8</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/06/02/Polar-1-19-8.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;polar-1198-released---better-payments-and-fixes&quot;&gt;Polar 1.19.8 Released - Better Payments and Fixes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    We've revamped our payments system for Polar Premium and
    the biggest change is that we're now accepting payments
    via Stripe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    We've manually migrated accounts from Open Collective and
    your payments will still process there while you have a
    regular premium account.  If you have any issues please
    feel free to contact &lt;b&gt;support@getpolarized.io&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    We're going to be working to bring on a few more premium
    features in the next couple weeks.  These include:


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Watch directories that can automatically import documents into Polar.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Markdown support&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dark mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    We're not 100% certain of the timeline on these features
    as some of them are a bit difficult to implement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    We're also working on a few major changes that are taking
    a bit longer - mostly because they're very technically
    complicated.  These aren't available yet but are 50-80%
    complete.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    This includes:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Folder view that extends our tagging system with a full hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Tabbed browsing for the desktop / Electron version of Polar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;ePub support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    If you'd like to see these features sooner rather than
    later the best way you can help (besides a pull request)
    is to upgrade to &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/pricing.html&quot;&gt;
    Polar Premium&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changes in 1.19.8 Include:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;New payment system for Polar premium based on Stripe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fixed bug when dragging area highlights.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fixed regression in the webapp where PHZ files couldn't be loaded.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;gpt-2-the-destruction-of-the-web-and-artificially-intelligent-textbooks&quot;&gt;GPT-2, the Destruction of the Web and Artificially Intelligent Textbooks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/&quot;&gt;GPT-2&lt;/a&gt; is a deep-learning
language model released by OpenAI a few months ago which is causing a bit of
controversy in the deep learning community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Due to our concerns about malicious applications of the technology, we are not
releasing the trained model. As an experiment in responsible disclosure, we are
instead releasing a much smaller model for researchers to experiment with, as
well as a technical paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI actually took a conservative position and decided to hold off from
releasing the model due to the potential impact on society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the first emerging technologies that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; frightens me.
There’s a massive potential or abuse here and I don’t think society is ready for
it just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many disruptive technologies we generally have a few years to come to grips
with the problems they might cause. Robotics, Crispr, and other technologies are
still a few years away from really impacting our lives (however it plays out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not true with GPT-2 - it’s here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 is a deep learning model released by OpenAI back in February which they
built by indexing 40GB of web content derived from a web crawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They indexed about 8M pages and then dumped it into a neural network&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It builds an internal linguistic model of the underlying text represented as a
neural network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps it understand the actual text but also it’s generative. This means
it can build NEW text based on a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a short example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;system-prompt&quot;&gt;System Prompt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part was generated by a human as the input prompt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a
remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more
surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect
English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;model-completion&quot;&gt;Model Completion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was generated by GPT-2, a computer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s
Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to
science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd
phenomenon is finally solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and
several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small
valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what
appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver
snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… this is just a short excerpt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/&quot;&gt;read more here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;could-it-destroy-the-web&quot;&gt;Could it Destroy the Web?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web is built on a number of assumptions which aren’t necessarily true
any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, that only humans can write legitimate content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past machine-generated text seemed, well, robotic. If you used a markov
chain to generate text it sounded like you would expect - like canned text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It went off topic. Didn’t make sense. They were words. They were a subset of 
language but they didn’t have much meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get a sense of how this works by using auto-complete on your mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start off with a sample sentence and let it auto-complete and just select 
the first match it will sound rather - insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my phone I entered “The cat is outside” and then hit next again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The cat is outside and is never told about Jesus do they go to the emergency
place of his own and they are crawling to be my friend.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, those are words. That’s technically a sentence. But it doesn’t make a 
ton of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 can write entire articles of text that sound like they were written by a
human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only do they seem human they’re also readable - you won’t get bored either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to lead to a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; amount of Google spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can write content for cheap you can use arbitrage and post content on the
web and then run ads against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can generate gigabytes of content for pennies you can make a lot of money
just cranking out fake content and spamming search engines..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legitimate marketers are going do to this too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why write new content when you could just crawl your competitors site and have
it generate content based on &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or just crawl your own content and have it generate new articles based on your
current articles as a system prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else could we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could create fake news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fake scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could spam your competitors support queue with fake technical support requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any background in SEO or search your heart is probably racing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a 20 minute break and meditate. We’ll be here when you get back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-the-upside&quot;&gt;What’s the upside?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any upside?  There is. I think it could have a dramatic and amazing
impact on spaced repetition and cognitive science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 could help build question and answer pairs by bulk processing large
textbooks to build flashcards for spaced repetition systems like Anki and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could also help with the raw &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; of the text so you could ask it
questions and it could provide you with answers. Far better than simple
full-text search!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full-text search will get you closer to an answer but you still have to spend a
bit of time reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With GPT-2 it could just flat out give you the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever read Diamond Age it could help build a “Young Lady’s Illustrated
Primer” or an artificially intelligent textbook that you can interact with
directly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would literally be able to interact with a textbook and ask it questions
from the material you’re reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Textbooks would no longer be sterile and inert. It could suggest other reading
based on your interests. You could interact with it and it could actually
&lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt; you directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can’t &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the text in the classical sense than you or I can. You 
can’t ask it mathematical questions and expect answers or questions that 
are more philosophical in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those still require humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mitigation&quot;&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some risk mitigation we could pursue. We could require public keys 
for users and only index content that is signed and build a trust model
similar to Pagerank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans can only write so much content. By using this model you’re going to 
throttle people by forcing their rank to flow between the graph of the web 
of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can create fake keys of course. They can fake key after key for their
fake robots but they have to attract REAL humans to certify them at some point
and you would only flow so much rank from a real human forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If search engines employed auditors to find and validate real people we could
keep the web from becoming owned by AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not perfect but I think there’s a path forward here though going in depth
is a bit ouf of scope for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-could-stop-gpt-2&quot;&gt;What Could Stop GPT-2?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we collectively decide that building and releasing something like 
GPT-2 is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could we stop it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t. It’s just a matter of time until this technology is democratized and
in the hands of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prices of GPUs and cloud computing is just getting cheaper and cheaper and 
eventually this is going to become commoditized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In five or so years you’ll be able to build a model like GPT-2 in a few days to 
weeks with very little funding and with off the shelf tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to have to deal with this one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 is really frightening but if we can mitigate the risks we might be able
to use these systems in the future and focus mostly on the positives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to need to educate older voters and people naive about modern
technology on the risks of trusting fake news and deep fakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be an uphill battle though. We already have fake news and we haven’t
done a good job dealing with it already. How are we going to deal with it when
its gets far far worse?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">13 Lucky Tips for using Anki and Spaced Repetition in 2019</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/25/13-lucky-tips-for-using-anki-and-spaced-repetition-2019.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="13 Lucky Tips for using Anki and Spaced Repetition in 2019" /><published>2019-05-25T10:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-25T10:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/25/13-lucky-tips-for-using-anki-and-spaced-repetition-2019</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/25/13-lucky-tips-for-using-anki-and-spaced-repetition-2019.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FeMzRL1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;13-lucky-tips-for-using-anki-and-spaced-repetition-in-2019&quot;&gt;13 Lucky Tips for using Anki and Spaced Repetition in 2019&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years I’ve been using Anki to capture anything I want to
remember long term.  If I’m reading an important Wikipedia page I save it to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt;, annotate it directly, then create flashcards 
from the annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this to my textbooks and anything else I find important enough to remember
forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason SR is so effective for me is it allows me to efficiently schedule
when to review the material. I’m not constantly reviewing material I already
know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my tips and tricks for using Anki and SR for language learning, pursing
a medical degree, undergraduate degree, or just trying to be the smartest person
in the room!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tips will work on any spaced repetition platform including Anki, Quizlet,
or Memrise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understand-how-it-works&quot;&gt;Understand How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you should read a bit about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition&quot;&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/a&gt; and make sure you know how
it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is key or you’re going to make silly mistakes and revert to the old strategy
of learning and cramming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/otv7GF0.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-it-easy&quot;&gt;Make it Easy.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating flashcards needs to be easy use a tool like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt; so that you can create flashcards, comments,
and annotations directly while you’re reading the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once created the flashcards can all be sync’d to Anki in batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prevents you from going back and forth between Anki and your reading app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Polar supports incremental reading so you can go back and forth
between books and continue where you left off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rbAwfR6.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;active-recall&quot;&gt;Active Recall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also understand why &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall&quot;&gt;active recall&lt;/a&gt; is so important&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Active recall is a principle of efficient learning, which claims the need to
actively stimulate memory during the learning process. It contrasts with passive
review, in which the learning material is processed passively (e.g. by reading,
watching, etc.). For example, reading a text about George Washington, with no
further action, is a passive review. Answering the question “Who was the first
US President?”, is active recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially you want everything to be a question and you want to have to think of the
answer. It’s this thinking process which allows your brain to map weights to specific
neurons and actually learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t give leading questions or give your self hints to the answer. If you don’t
know the questions that’s fine.  Just fail it so it’s brought up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;habit-habit-habit&quot;&gt;Habit, Habit, Habit.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You couldn’t sit down at the end of the month and brush your teeth for 2-3 hours
to make up for not brushing would you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has to be a habit. You have to do it every day for 15-45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do it when you have dead time.  During  your commute. While you’re in line at the DMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you’re bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;85-90-difficulty&quot;&gt;85-90 Difficulty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should try to target 85-90% difficulty for your cards. If you go into Anki 
stats you can see the difficulty level for your recent usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too easy and you’re probably reviewing too often (and wasting time).  Too hard
and you’re not going to learn anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want it to be difficult to not too difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Anki doesn’t tun itself so you have to tune Anki directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be adjusted in the per-deck settings by changing the ease factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;think-long-term&quot;&gt;Think LONG Term.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t give up on cards after you’ve finished a class or other milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool thing about SR is that you can keep the material forever.  If you paid
money to learn Calculus you might as well keep it.  Once you’ve learned it
using SR is mostly about maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you know the material the scheduling will get farther and farther in the
future and there won’t be such a massive burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-the-right-card-type&quot;&gt;Use the Right Card Type&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should prefer to use question and answer cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are in the form of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q: What is the capital of California?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A: Sacramento&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be as opposed to cloze deletion cards like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Sacramento] is the capital of California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above the ‘Sacramento’ string is hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloze deletion cards might seem easy but they often give away context clues
which weakens the entire point of SR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloze-deletions-for-languages&quot;&gt;Cloze Deletions for Languages.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one main exception for cloze deletion cards - languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloze can be good to help with grammar and sentence structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should NOT replace Q/A cards though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a given word you should have the definition and the forward and reverse translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;person-cards--remember-a-persons-face&quot;&gt;Person cards.  Remember a Person’s Face!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite hacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have trouble with matching names to faces and I used to avoid talking to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just create a card with their picture and the answer is their name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really help avoid awkward social situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qP4My84.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;related-cards&quot;&gt;Related Cards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling with a card try creating related cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if you have difficulties remembering the reasons for the start of WWII
make flashcards about those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to include Pearl Harbor for example maybe you include facts about
the ships or the types of attacks that were involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-only-beneficial-cards&quot;&gt;Create only Beneficial Cards.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t create nonsense cards. Ask yourself will this really help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that SR is an efficient scheduler so going from 5-10k cards isn’t 2x
more work.  It is initially but quickly your spacings increase and you’re going
to just be reviewing a few cards per day again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by only keeping important cards in there this helps you avoid card
burnout since you’re never wondering “why” you’re learning these cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The why is because they’re valuable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing key facts might still land you that job.  If you know a technical term
during an interview or due diligence it could help convince the interviewer that
you know your stuff.  Consider adding it anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-shingling-to-remember-speeches&quot;&gt;Use ‘shingling’ to Remember Speeches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not include entire speeches to remember. Instead. Use overlapped sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example. If you want to remember the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Break this out into three cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A: Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q: Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A: We are met on a great battle-field of that war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q: We are met on a great battle-field of that war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A: We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help you connect the parts without having to choke on a massive card with the entire speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-absurdity-and-keep-it-fun&quot;&gt;Use Absurdity and Keep it Fun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were driving to work and you saw a naked man riding a horse on the side
of the road would you need to remember it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you have to write it down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. It would burn in your mind.  You’d remember this image for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do this for your anki cards you’re trying to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you met a guy and his name is “Mark Nun”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I just made this up btw. If your name is Mark Nun we don’t know each other!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture this guy as an actual nun wearing a nun’s uniform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re never going to forget this guy’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this all the time and it’s a great hack.  You can do this for your cards to by
mapping images with the cards that are absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-extra-fields&quot;&gt;Use Extra Fields&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create an ‘extra’ field with your cards so that you can add notes and pictures
so that when you fail to remember you can get back to the original context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll often put the book information.  The actual text of where I saw the card, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a feature for Polar to add this directly so that when you create
a flashcard in Polar we automatically create a card with the context so you 
can click back to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial version will probably just have a link back to the Polar webapp to
avoid bloating Anki with too many images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-stories-and-etymology&quot;&gt;Use Stories and Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attach ‘extra’ stories to the material as above but make them stories or use
imagery to remember the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that etymology works VERY well for learning languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example.  The German word for sea is meer which is related to the English word
marine which is also related to mare (spanish / italian for sea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those connections make it easier to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SR won’t replace the work of actually understanding the material.  This is still
your job.  If you’re still confused on a subject try reading it from different
perspectives of from different authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the above tips to keep moving forward with spaced repetition. Use a tool
like Polar to easily create flashcards and sync them to Anki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you’re also using the right Anki plugins and that you’re using it to
full effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
