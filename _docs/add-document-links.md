# "Add Document" Links for Easily Adding Documents to Polar

Polar supports a feature to allow allow any users to add a document to Polar simply by clicking on a link.

The interesting part is that it supports any PDF document on the web that's publicly accessible.

Here's an <a href="https://app.getpolarized.io/add/https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">example link to the Bitcoin Whitepaper</a>.

Here's what it looks like when rendered in the user's browser.

This allows for easy integration with Polar and 3rd party sites.

To create a link all you need to do is take an ordinary URL and prefix it with the following:

<code>https://app.getpolarized.io/add</code>

For example if you have a URL like: 

<code>https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</code>

Then you can create the Polar add document URL like:

<code><b>https://app.getpolarized.io/add/</b>https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</code>
