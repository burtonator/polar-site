# Getting Started 

Polar is an advanced document management and knowledge repository for people very serious about their education.

It provides tools to manage documents, annotations, and includes flashcards and incremental reading powered by spaced repetition.

# Pick the Right Platform

Polar supports both desktop and web and supports cloud sync and storage and sync of your across devices.

We have desktop apps for Windows, MacOS, and Linux which you can [download here](https://getpolarized.io/download.html).

The [web version of Polar](https://app.getpolarized.io) runs on Chrome, and Firefox [^1] and supports almost all functionality as the desktop app except 
for offline support which will come in the future. 

# Local or Cloud

The desktop app supports a local-only version which does not use cloud sync. 

If you're in China (which blocks our cloud provider) you will need to use this mode. 

Otherwise we recommend using the cloud version which is used automatically if you're using the web version of Polar
or if you login to cloud sync on the desktop app.

Cloud sync also allows you to use the [mobile](/docs/mobile.html) versions of Polar as well.

# Footnotes
