# Folders

Polar supports folders for managing your files in a hierarchy.

We support both basic tags and 'hierarchical' tags.

To create a hierarchical tag, prefix the tag with a /. Example: /my/custom/hierarchy.

Once you tag a document with a hierarchical tag a folder will be created in the sidebar. 

Regular tags are shown in the document to the right of the document title and hierarchical tags are shown in the left 
pane/sidebar.

## Creating folders

Folders are just tags that have a path.  For example ```linux``` would be a regular tag.  But '/tech/linux' would be 
a folder.  

A document can be stored in multiple folders just like a document can have multiple tags. 

## Filtering

You can also select tags just on a specific folder for further filtering:

The annotations view also supports the folder setup. The main difference is that you're now filtering by annotations
and not documents and the counts per folder are different (annotations vs documents).
