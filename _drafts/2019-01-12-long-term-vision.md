# Polar Long Term Vision

I wanted to finally take the time and write up my long term vision of where
Polar is going as well as discuss some anti-goals (or at least secondary goals)
of the project.

At first glance, Polar is designed around the idea of maintaining all your
documents in one place, annotating them with highlights, comments, managing your
documents with tags, and maintaining key extracted knowledge via spaced
repetition.

I believe this is a new class of application which we will see more players over
the next decade - at least I hope so as competition is a good thing.

# Knowledge Management Platforms

Polar is a Knowledge Management Platform (KMP) designed to maintain an external 
repository of everything critical to your education.

This includes all your books, annotations, notes, and flashcards.

The more you use your KMP the more value it has but additionally the greater 
risk that its failure would have a negative impact on your life and your career.

If the company that runs your KMP goes out of business you're entire education 
might be in jeopardy.

While you might still have a copy of the data you won't be able to actually 
use the notes or at the very minimum your notes will have less value as they're
not exactly usable.

This is why I went with the name Polar.  A "polar" repository essentially freezes
and protects all your knowledge and maintains its integrity.  A Polar repository
is designed to follow through your entire career.  Everything that you learn in 
college (or in your spare time) is kept in Polar to prevent forgetting key 
material.

This is why spaced repetition is important for Polar.  Without spaced repetition 
managing such a massive repository of information would not be manageable.    

## Data Integrity.

This is why the data integrity of Polar is critical.

One of our primary goals is that you control the data and you can export at 
any time and the file formats used are self describing and easy to work with.

While they might not necessarily be an Open Standard (yet) you can export 
and easily write tools to migrate to another platform should you wish.

# Long Term Education

Be honest. If you took the final exam from high school Calc I would you pass?

Maybe you would if you were a mathematician or a math teacher but if your career
is in politics (or an unrelated field) you would probably fail.

This is because everything we learn has a rate of decay.  In computer science
we call this "bit rot."

Generally, for neurological systems (AKA humans) if the neural connectivity 
isn't regularly exercised - it's lost.  

Simply put - you forget.

We force students to go through the gauntlet, pass the exams, then don't care 
that they've forgotten the material.

I think this is a tragedy.

It doesn't make sense to get a degree just to forget everything you've learned.

Granted a lot of key material is kept but you lose key detail.

Polar is designed to combat this problem and it's one of our primary goals.

Polar enables you to go heads down on learning complex topics without the worry
that what you learn will just be forgotten.   

# Flashcards

In 2016 I decided to do an experiment with Duolingo and see if I could teach
myself a language in my spare time.

Since I was a boy I developed a habit of reading while I was idle.  If I was 
waiting a the DMV or in line to order a coffee I would read the news, politics, 
or listen to podcasts.

However, I felt that what I was learning wasn't very valuable to my career or 
education in the long term.

The latest tech or political gossip just isn't very useful and has a finite 
shelf life. 

However, learning a new language, a new branch of mathematics, studying history 
- these things would benefit me for the rest of my life. 

What if it was possible to learn this type of material without actually having 
to sit down and read a text book?  What if it was possible to maintain the 
material long term?  

I began just developing a habit of taking out Duolingo when I had a few minutes
to kill.

The results were really amazing and convinced me that spaced repetition is an
amazingly powerful and underrated tool.

In about a year of stealing 5-10 minutes here and there I was able to gain 
basic conversational skills in German.  I now regularly listen to German 
podcasts and TV shows - though I admit that I'm still stuck on some grammar 
and issues with pronounciation.

## Collaborative Flashcards

The problem with this style of asynchronous learning is that without sitting
down to study a text book you can't make flashcards.

This is definitely a valuable use but what if we refactored the way we looked
at text books.

What if text books were actually secondary material and the primary material
were flashcards?
